Reinforcement Learning framework for stock trading with predictive wealth optimization using SPY ETF data

**Project**: AI-Driven Stock Trading Using Q-Learning and Streamlit Dashboard

**Objective**: Developed a Reinforcement Learning framework to optimize wealth by predicting profitable trading strategies and simulating their performance over historical SPY ETF data.

**Data Preprocessing**: Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and normalization to prepare the dataset for model training and evaluation, ensuring reliable risk-reward assessment.

**Architectural Framework**: Implemented Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, to learn optimal trading policies based on historical price movements and portfolio state.

**Dashboard Integration**: Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard deployed on Heroku for real-time visualization and simulation of trading strategies, enabling intuitive monitoring of portfolio performance.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Streamlit, Heroku, Q-Learning, Reinforcement Learning, EDA, and predictive modeling.
